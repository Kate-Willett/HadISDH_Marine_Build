# HadISDH_Marine_Build

Notes on modifying EUSTACE_SST_MAT code to work with humidity data.

Kate Willett and Robert Dunn

This code is a branch from:

svn://fcm9/ClimateMonitoringAttribution_svn//EUSTACE/EUSTACE_SST_MAT 

It was branched off by Robert Dunn on 3rd Feb 2016 at some time in the
afternoon.

It is now hosted in a GitHub repository - Robert Dunn and Kate Willett are
collaborators:

https://github.com/Kate-Willett/HadISDH_Marine_Build

******************************************************************
The Plan:

Modify code to only use ship and moored buoy platform types - should speed up a little in later years with ARGOs?

Modify read in routines to pull out dew point temperature (and possibly other
humidity variables when they exist, wet bulb temperaure, relative humidity) and
also humidity related metadata (instrument type, ship height???). 

Add code to convert T and dew point T to q, e, RH, DPD, Tw.

Add qc routines to work on Td, q, e, RH, Tw and DPD.

Add initial pentad climatology fields for Td, q, e, RH, Tw and DPD - most likely from
ERA-Interim so using 1981-2010 climatology period.

Modify the qc software to also run the qc routines.

Add code to bias correct the humidity data for ship height (adjust to 10m)
following methods described in Berry and Kent, 2011.

Add code to bias correct the humidity data for screened instruments verses hand
held instruments following methods described in Berry and Kent, 2011.

Add code to assess uncertainties in the hourly data: rounding, measurement,
height bias adjustment, instrument type adjustment.

Add code to grid the data.

Add code to assess climatological uncertainties at the gridbox scale

Add code to assess the sampling uncertainty at the gridbox scale

Add code to combine the gridbox level uncertainties and also somehow establish a
covariance matrix.

Work Done:

Feb 4th 2016
Made '# KW' comments in make_and_full_qc.py, Extended_IMMA.py, IMMA2.py and
qc.py as I understand the code flow.

Made '# KW' comments on possible ways to speed up the code that may or may not
be possible/sensible:
 - 1) for each loop through the candidate month save the candidate and proceding
 month of processed data for the next candidate month. Shift candidate month to
 be preceding month, proceding month to be candidate month and read in new
 proceding month. This may not be that simple as you may have to reset any track
 and buddy QC flags (unless suggestion 2 can be implemented) and search through the reps for
 any 'YR', 'MO' that match the preceding year and remove. base and other qc
 flags would not need to be reset because they do not use any other obs other
 than clim and st devs.
 - 2) for track check and buddy check only apply process to actual candidate
 years. This would mean parsing the CandYR and CandMO through to the tests
 somehow. This would mean no resetting would be necessary if you keep the needed
 months in the memory for each loop through.

Found a bug:
 - make_and_full_qc.py
 Removed second instance of 'inputfile' which sets it to
 configuration_local.txt
 Added the 'data_base_dir' set up so that the ascii files are output to a
 different directory - changed output code here too.
 Changed 'year' to 'readyear' at line 322 if readyear > 2007: because if the
 candidate year month was 2008, January then it tried to read R2.5.2.2007.12
 instead of R2.5.1.2007.12.
 Note that December 2007 is a bit dodge - its the time when they stopped putting
 in the callsigns. John isn't sure whether this has been corrected for yet ini
 R2.5.1 - we only have R2.5.1 for Dec 2007 in the /project/ archive.
 Note also that from Jan 2008 the file size grows massively - I think this is
 why the code fell over for a run on Jan 2008.
 
 Tidied up:
 Its apparent that quite a few of the scripts aren't needed to run from
 make_and_full_qc.py. Some would be needed if the SQL database is invoked. Some
 would be needed should you wish to run any parts seperately. It looks like a
 lot of the individual scripts have now been ingested as functions into a few
 larger scripts: Extended_IMMA.py, qc.py, IMM2.py and qc_new_track_check.py and
 spherical_geometry.py. I'm rerunning with all other files moved to /REDUNDANT/
 to see what happens.
 Ran for Dec 1973 and it has worked fine.
 
 Next:
 I would like to try running with some additional things:
 - only pulling through ship and moored buoy. This may not be what we want to do
 in the long run for the database but it should speed things up for now,
 especially in the float dense later years.
 - pulling in extra variables, converting to other humidity variables and
 outputting
 - qc-ing Td in addition to MAT before converting to other humidity variables
 - bringing in ERA as a TD clim and sd
 - buddy checking Td (or is it preferable to buddy check something else?)
 - bias adjustments for Td???
 - uncertainty estimates for all
 
 I would then like to try and optimise the code:
 - remove unnecessary SST qc, track and buddy check to save run time - althouhg it may be a useful
 cross-check on ob quality. Set all to fail on write out.
 - try to save read ins of candidate and proceding month with each iteration to
 save read in and processing time.
 - try to only apply track and buddy check to candidate month
 
 I would then like to try gridding
 - select only night obs
 - select only day obs
 - select both day and night obs?
 - explore gridding of different decks?
Feb 4th 2016
First off I want to see if it runs as is with just a change to the output file
directories. I have modified:

configuration.txt
I have changed all of the filepaths to work with
/project/hadobs2/hadisdh/marine/ and copied over all static files needed from
John's directories. I have changed to my hostname eld256 - Robert will need to
change to his own on his working version.

configuration_commented.txt
I have made a second version of configuration.txt where comments on the lines
can be kept without interfering with the code.


Feb 3rd 2016
I have made an OLD_CODE_FEB2016 directory and copied all files as they are into here to
keep a static version of this code for us to look back at if need be. These
files SHOULD NOT be modified.

Notes:

Work with make_and_full_qc.py. This doesn't actually build or populate the SQL
database but pulls out and QCs the ICOADS month by month and stores as ASCII.
